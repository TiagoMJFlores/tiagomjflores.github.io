The WALK zone app is intended to provide an exploring experience/emotion such as the Calm app (https://www.calm.com/) offers a relaxation experience/emotion.
The app encourages the exploration of geographic locations by creating dynamic paths through the joining of random waypoints.
To make the experience more entertaining the app also makes use of augmented reality and gamification.

## HISTORY OF CREATION

In 2019 I participated in the 9th edition of the Acredita Portugal contest.
The 9th edition of the contest Montepio Acredita Portugal was the largest competition for entrepreneurship in Portugal
and the second largest in the world, had a total of 10,340 team entries.
Using the design and business plan of the initial prototype Walk Zone app (at the time called the Hike Zone) I reached the group of semi-finalists group that had only 300 teams.

From a business point of view the purpose of the app was to create a habit of daily use through a component of variability and good experience of use and use this as leverage to create a platform where we could sell geolocalized advertising.
We also sought to provide an opportunity for companies to market content to consumers through the distribution of augmented reality contents.

## App Features

The current prototype is still rudimentary but have some of the basic functionality.
currently WALK zone allows the generation of random routes from the user's current geographic location according to a user-defined travel time in minutes.
The app gives currencies at waypoints (gamification component) and sometimes shows augmented reality content.

## Technology

The app uses MapKit.
