During the summer the fires are always a big problem in Portugal.
In 2017 a great fire happened at Pedrógão Grande that killed about 66 people.
At that time the [`bombeiros.pt`](https://bombeiros.pt/) organization already had developed an Android app that helped the firemen to perform their functions but also needed to create the iOS version. So I thought it was a good cause and volunteered to create the iOS version.

## Personal Projects

## App Features

The app has several useful functions for firefighters as information listing, calculators and a PANIC button to help the fire department in case of danger.

### Information listing

*  Contextual news for firefighters
*  Information about the fire brigades
*  Information about the water points
*  Information about the dangerous materials


### Calculators

* Calculator to calculate fire risk
* Glasgow comma calculator
* Capacity calculator for oxygen cylinders


### Panic Button

* The PANIC button sends an sms message with the firefigther GPS coordinates to the contacts defined in the application.

## Media

Several news about the app appeared in the main news websites of Portugal:

## Thanks

I have to thank Nuno, the volunteer firefighter who made the Android app.
He was always willing to clarify doubts about the "business logic" and available to test the app. I also thank Sérgio Cipriano who provided the Design.
