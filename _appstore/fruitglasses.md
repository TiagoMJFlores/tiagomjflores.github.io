I began to develop interest in Augmented Reality and Computer Vision especially when I heard rumors
that Apple would release smart glasses in the future.
So I decided to develop a small project to test Apple's APIs and tools.

## Video Demo
[See Here](https://youtu.be/Y1IuyVyK4bc)

## App Features

The app lets you point the camera to a piece of fruit and show off a balloon with nutritional information.
Note: The model is currently only trained to detect bananas and oranges. Some will be added later.

## Technology

The Machine Learning model was created using CreateML.
The app uses CoreML, Vision Framework, ARKit and SpriteKit to renderer the Views.
The Fruit Nutrition information is obtained from the API:

## Test Flight

* (Will be added soon)
