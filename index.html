  Welcome to my personal page!

  My name is Tiago Flores.
  I am a mobile developer with almost 5 years of experience on iOS and I love doing what I do :heart: . 
  
  I am highly motivated to learn new technologies, new ways to look at the software design process and any new ways to create the software in a better way than before.

  I am an avid reader but I also believe that writing is important. Write and share about what we learn is one of the best ways to learn. 

  Write, about some something that we learn, force us to think about it a second time and organize better the concepts inside our minds.
  I believe too that there is a strong relationship between good communication and good programming.
  Writing is about communication, and each module of code that you write is like a future message to the programmer that will maintain and extend it.

  Here you will find some information about my journey on the iOS universe.
