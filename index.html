introduction: |
  Welcome to my personal page!

  My name is Tiago Flores.
  I have a degree in computer science and I’ve been developing for iOS for over 6 years.

  I'm in love with technology :heart:. 
  Arthur C. Clarke said “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”
  and I believe that developers are the magicians of the 21st century.
 
  I also like to read about User Experience from an amateur/ hobbyist position and I have already taken some courses related with it.
  Maybe that's why I like Apple so much!
  Apple mission statement is "to bringing the best user experience to its customers through its innovative hardware, software, and services.”"

  Besides seeing technology as a delight medium for users, I also see myself as a problem solver that removes pain points.
  Technology is my main tool and i use technology as a leverage to solve business and customer problems.

  Here you will find some information about my journey on the iOS universe.
